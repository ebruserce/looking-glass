## PROJECT OVERVIEW
todo: revise and turn into paragraph
- Goal: find correlations between eye movement and brain activity when looking at familiar vs unfamiliar faces
- Approach
    - 1: generating unfamiliar faces 
    - 2: processing brain data
    - 3: processing eye movement data

## FILE DESCRIPTIONS
- `yaya/` is a directory of CSV files from the pilot study of eye tracking and EEG data. Files are named after what faces were used to generate the stimuli and what % the morph occured at.
- `eeg/` is a directory of utils to graph/log EEG data from petal.
- `README.md` is a markdown file (what you're looking at right now) with information on the repository as a whole.
- `app.py` is the old version of the data collection app which used threads in order to simultaneously collect eeg data, eye tracking data, and display stimuli to the user.
- `eeg_utils.py` is a utility function file which includes processing and streaming functions for dealing with EEG data.
- `eigenfaces.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook (mix of Python cells + markdown) containing experiments for morphing faces using eigenfaces.
- `faceutils.py` is a utility function file which includes functions for creating stimuli, especially aligning and morphing faces.
- `sanitychecks.ipynb` is an old Jupyter notebook with sanity checks used to verify data quality for the pilot study.
- `shape predictors` are .dat files for getting face landmarks used for aligning faces prior to the morphing steps.
- `test_data.ipynb` contains preliminary figures and analysis from the pilot study.
- `utils.py` contains remaining auxiliary utility functions, especially for eye tracking data.

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION
todO

## ARCHIVED

USAGE:
0. set subject name in app2 and app3 to set saving directory
1. set INDEX_CHANNELS in app2 to select what nodes to record from
- note that temporal resolution and number of nodes have a significant tradeoff
2. run app2.py w/ eye tracker (show to subject) and run app3.py by running Petal Metrics first (this will run EEG collection in VSCode and does not open in browser)
3. syncing step: subject should blink several times while facing away from the screen. We can use this data to sync the eye-tracking and eeg clocks
4. app2.py will stop running automatically, you must press 'q' in terminal for app3.py to stop running. Data saves after both apps terminate.

NOTES:
- app3.py to record eye-tracking and display images
- app2.py to record EEG data

TODOs:

- fix build_dataset function✅
- add flagging functionality ✅
- finish modifying StyleGAN with different anchor points and weighting parameters
- conglomerate script -> input a json file of people objects with name, familiarity, image.
    - outputs a folder with correct images
- finally input folder name with images to use in app ✅
- build up UI for st app ✅
- eye tracking ✅
- eeg recording ✅

- script should include info on initial calibration step with tobii
